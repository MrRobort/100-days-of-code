# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3rd 2017 (The Hashtag Generator & Integers: Recreation One)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Hashtag Generator and Recreation One Kata's [@codewars](https://www.codewars.com)

**Thoughts:** The Hashtag generator challenge was nice, generating hashtags from a string if not greater than 140 characters :smile:.
The Recreation One Challenge was a cool one too, returning the sum of possible squared numbers and the number itself; the factor.

### Day 1: January 4th 2017 (Valid Braces)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Valid Braces kata on [codewars](https://www.codewars.com)

**Thoughts:** The Challenge struck me a bit 'cos my thoughts were too shallow but i figured it out on the long run by just replacing the braces with nothing :smile: then if the final length of braces equals 0 then it's valid.

### Day 2: January 5th 2017 (RGB to Hex & Palindrome Chain Length)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on RGB to Hex and Palindrome Chain Length kata's and i moved up in rank(5 kyu) [@codewars](https://www.codewars.com)

**Thoughts:** The RGB to Hex was fun because i knew `Number.toString(16)` converts to hexademical, so i just applied it and made sure it was between 0 and 255. Palindrome Chain Length was quite an easy one for a 5 kyu challenge [@codewars](https://www.codewars.com); if the number supplied is a Palindrome, return 0 cos no steps were involved in achieving that, else, add the Palindrome of the supplied number to the number... Keep on doing that till you finally get a Palindrome, then return the number of times you went through to achieve the Palindrome.

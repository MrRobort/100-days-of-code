# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3rd 2017 (The Hashtag Generator & Integers: Recreation One)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Hashtag Generator kata and Recreation One Challenge via [@codewars](https://www.codewars.com)

**Thoughts:** The Hastag generator challenge was nice, generating hastags from a string if not greater than 140 characters :smile:.
The Recreation One Challenge was a cool one too, returning the sum of possible squared numbers and the number itself; the factor.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
